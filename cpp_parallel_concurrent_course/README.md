# Parallel and Concurrent Programming with C++

## Parallel Computing Hardware

### Sequential versus Parallel Computing

* Serial execution: program broken down into series of instructions; can only execute one instruction at a time. Limitations: speed of processor determines how quickly program to execute.
* Parallel execution: break down instructions into independent parts that can be processed by different processors, coordinate steps. Doesn't necessarily means it will run a lot faster, but must have element of coordination and communication. 
* When done right, parallel execution increases throughput: accomplish a single task fast; accomplish more tasks in a given time.
