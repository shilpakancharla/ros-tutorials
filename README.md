# What is ROS?

* A toolkit to help you build robots

* Primarily a message passing service that helps standardize communications across different pieces of a robot

* Since the messages are standard, it also provides many pre-built libraries and tools that interface with this system so you can take advantage of years of community work.

# How to organize code?

* In many software projects OOP is used to allow for different sections of code be isolated and reused.

* ROS does not rely on this, and instead relies on software being written as many programs that communicate with one another.

# Interprogram communication

## OS Provided communicated

* Different everywhere

* Only works on one system

## ROS communication

* Standard

* Flexible

* Easy to program

# Terms

* A __node__ is a program within ROS and is the most basic unit of code storage.

* A node can be spawned (started) by ROS and it can communicate with other nodes.

* A __topic__ is a communication channel between nodes. Think radio stations: one node broadcasts, other can choose to listen in.

* A topic can only send out one TYPE of message (i.e., string, numbers, etc.)

* A node can publish many topics and listen to many topics.

* A __message__ is a single piece of information sent across a topic (i.e., one number, one string, etc.)

* A __package__ is a collection of related nodes that are compiled together and have shared dependencies.

# Gazebo

* __World__: collection of robots and objects (such as buildings, tables, and lights), and global parameters including the sky, ambient light, and physics properties.

* __Static__: entities marked as static (those having the `<static>true</static>` element in SDF), are ojbects which only have collision geometry. All objects which are not meant to move should be maked as static, which is a performance enhancement.

* __Dynamic__: entities marked as dynamic (either missing the `<static>` element or setting false in SDF), are objects which have both intertia and a collision geometry. 

## Position Models

The pose of each model may be altered through the translate and rotate tools: 

### Translation

The translate tool allows you to move the object along the x, y, and z axes. Select this tool now (or press `t`) and click on the object you want to move. A three axes visual marker will appear over the object, which allows you to move the object in x, y, and z directions. 

* You can also just click on the object itself and drag it to move on the x-y plane. You may control which axis the object moves along by pressing and holding the `x`, `y`, or `z` key while dragging the object. 

* You can hold the `Ctrl` key to snap the movement to a 1 meter grid. 

* If the object is not aligned with the world (for example after you use the rotate tool explained next), you can hold the `Shift` key so the visual markers show up aligned with the world, and you can translate in world coordinates.

### Rotation

The rotate tool allows you to orient a model around the x, y, and z axes. Select this tool now (or press `r`) and click on the object you want to move. Three ring-shaped visual marker over the object, which allows you to rotate the object around the x, y, and z axes. 

* You can also just click on the object itself and hold the `x`, `y`, or `z` keys while dragging it to the constraint the motion to one of these axes. 

* You can hold the `Ctrl` key to snap the movmeent to 45 degree increments. 

* If the object is not aligned with the world, you can hold the `Shift` key so the visual markers show up aligned witht he world, and you can rotate about the world axes. 

### Scale

The scale tool allows you to resize a model in the x, y, and z directions. Currently the scale tool only works with simple shapes, i.e., box, cylinder and sphere. Select this tool now (or press `s`) and click on a simple shape. A three axes visual marker will appear over the object, which allows you to scale the x, y, and z dimensions of the object. 

* You can also just click on the object itself and hold the `x`, `y`, or `z` keys while dragging it to constrant the scaling to one of these axes. 

* You can hold the `Ctrl` key to scale in 1 meter increments.
